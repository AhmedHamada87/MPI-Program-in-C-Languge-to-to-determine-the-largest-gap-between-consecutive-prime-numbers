# MPI Program in C Languge to to determine the largest gap between consecutive prime numbers
Course Project for the PreMaster Degree .
In this problem, we aim to determine the largest gap between consecutive prime numbers for all integers less than 1,000,000. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The gap between consecutive prime numbers is defined as the difference between a prime number and the prime number that immediately follows it. Understanding these gaps is significant in the field of number theory and has applications in cryptography and random number generation.

Given the computationally intensive nature of prime number identification, especially for large ranges, parallel processing offers a solution. By distributing the workload across multiple processors, we can significantly reduce the computation time. Parallel processing leverages the simultaneous execution of processes to expedite complex calculations, making it an ideal approach for this problem.
